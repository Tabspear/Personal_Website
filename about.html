          <span>Over the</span> years, I have had several causes to narrate my
          person. The most common narrative is that I, Taofeek Abiola Badmus had
          Bachelors and Masters' Degrees in Arabic Studies and a Postgraduate
          Diploma in Education. Another close up narrative is that I graduated the
          best student in Undergraduate class and was a recipient of several awards
          including;The Arab League Prize in Arabic and Islamic Studies, Forum for
          Islamic Education and Welfare for the Best Graduating Student in Arabic
          and Islamic Studies and The Omo Oba Rasheed Adesokan Prize in Arabic and
          Islamic Studies.
          <br />
          <span>It is</span> also common knowledge that I have mentored several
          students and worked as a translator. My hobbies are not far-fetched. they
          include, reading, watching classics and volunteering.
          <br />
          <span>What</span> is uncommon is that I am in the process of swapping
          careers to web development and to achieve this goal, I joined the Testify
          career launchpad in software testing where I learnt the rudiments of
          software testing and user experience.
          <br />
          <span>Currently</span> I am at the close of web development training by
          Bitwise industries and would be advancing in my quest to improve my tech
          skills with other available modules. I am open to job
          opportunities/internships/ apprenticeships that would assist me in
          achieving my goals.
